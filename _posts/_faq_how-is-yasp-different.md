Here are some of the features we think set YASP apart from other sites.  We also try to focus our development on features that aren't available elsewhere.

* Free public match replay parsing.  Other sites offer public match parsing for a price, or parse only professional matches for free.  Replay parsing allows us to extract much more data from games than the API offers.
* Open source.  We keep our code open source, so anyone can help contribute, or use our code for their own projects.  We also offer JSON downloads of player and match data for users to do their own analysis.
* Better querying.  We offer a flexible and powerful querying tool so that users can filter/extract interesting stats from their own match data.
* Visualizations.  We do some pretty cool visualizations of player match data, such as histograms, heatmaps, and word clouds.
