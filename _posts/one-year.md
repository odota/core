We released YASP to the public [one year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2sp595/introducing_yasp_a_free_opensource_stats_website/).
That was a big and ugly day for us. We quickly shot up to 2,000+ users, and we were only prepared for less than 100! We scrambled to handle the load,
rewriting a ton of code to handle the influx of users and games.

Since that storied day, YASP has grown leaps and bounds. Some YASP stats (ha):
* 30,000+ games parsed per day, peaking to 45,000+ on weekends
* 90,000 matches added per day
* 26,000 current tracked users, 53,000 peak
* 85,000 signed in users
* 100 million matches in our database, with 4.5+ million parsed
* 830 donators
* 15+ servers

And over the year, we’ve continually made improvements to YASP. To name a few:
* [A month after we released](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2xhk84/yasp_free_game_stats_and_replay_parsing_better/),
  we added [MMR Tracking](https://yasp.co/blog/35), [requests](https://yasp.co/blog//request), and [heatmaps](https://yasp.co/matches/2053267901/performances)
* [Two months later](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/339c6p/yasp_introducing_teamfight_analysis_and_more/cqipysp), we added 
  [teamfights](http://yasp.co/matches/1408333834/teamfights) and [objectives](http://yasp.co/matches/1408333834/objectives)
* For our [sixth month](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3kcgla/yasp_source_2_ads/) of release, we added Source 2 support.
* We [then added](https://yasp.co/blog/29) [matchmaking stats](https://yasp.co/mmstats), [player trends](https://yasp.co/players/102344608/trends), 
 and [actions](https://yasp.co/matches/2053267901/actions)
* Dramatic [infrustructure improvements](https://yasp.co/blog/32)
* Individual [performance analysis](https://yasp.co/blog/34)
* [Data dumps](https://yasp.co/blog/33) for those machine learning enthusiasts out there

In this year, we’ve remained completely [open source](https://github.com/yasp-dota/yasp) and free. We even [removed all ads](https://yasp.co/blog/28)!
We’re still supported completely through the generous Dota 2 community through [Cheese](https://yasp.co/carry).

We hope to supply you and the Dota 2 community with free stats for many years to come!

Happy Dota, and here's to an even better year two!
