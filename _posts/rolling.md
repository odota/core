YASP is switching to a rolling release model!

<!--more-->

Previously, we've been "bundling" features into relatively large releases and bumping our version numbers along the way.

However, since YASP runs as a web application rather than client-downloaded code, it's not as necessary for us to keep track of what version is currently running.

We're going to start switching to rolling releases, where we try to release features and updates individually on a more frequent basis.
This should also help us avoid bugs that occur when we roll out major changes all at once.

The version number will probably remain at 3 for the forseeable future (unless we make a really big change and decide to mark it with a version bump).
