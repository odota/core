When you first log in, the games we have are games where you played with a YASP user.
We begin watching your games after the first login.
You're also added to a queue to get your full match history.  This can take a while depending on how long the queue is.

Note on full history: due to Valve API limitations, we can only get 500 games per hero per player.
If you really wanted, you could request the remaining matches manually by ID.
