Howard's a software engineer (Duke University '15) and casual Dota 2 player.
His favorite heroes are Nature's Prophet, Terrorblade, and Lycan, so he's probably that guy you hate in your pub matches.
He also enjoys playing ultimate and board games.

Howard works on the replay parsing/backend design, making sure the system can scale properly.  He also built the heatmap, word cloud, querying, and "played with" features.
