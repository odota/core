Howard's a software engineer (Duke University '15) and casual Dota 2 player.
His favorite heroes are Nature's Prophet, Terrorblade, and Lycan, so he's probably that guy you hate in your pub matches.
He also enjoys playing ultimate and board games.

Howard wrote most of the code and is constantly playing with new technologies to strive for better performance and lower cost.
